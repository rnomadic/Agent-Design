# Multiagent LangGraph Example

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. The main use cases for LangGraph are conversational agents, and long-running, 
multi-step LLM applications or any LLM application that would benefit from built-in support for persistent checkpoints, 
cycles and human-in-the-loop interactions (ie. LLM and human collaboration).

This is an example agent to deploy a tech news agent (multiagent system) with LangGraph Studio.
