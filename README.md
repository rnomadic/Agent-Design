Try to go though the codebase as per the sequence. This design is based out of Python Object Orient Design, SOLID Principle.

Below is the snapshot of SOLID is all about.

**The 4 pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python are:**

**•	Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
**•	Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and providing a simplified interface.
**•	Inheritance:** Allowing a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.
**•	Polymorphism:** Using a single interface to represent different data types or objects.
